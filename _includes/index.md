## Blockchain Certificates Project

Blockcerts is an open-source ecosystem for creating, sharing, and verifying [blockchain-based educational certificates](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/certificates-reputation-and-the-blockchain-aee03622426f). These digital certificates are registered on the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptographically signed, tamper proof, and shareable. Our goal is to enable a wave of innovation that results in learners having the capacity to possess and share official records of achievement. We invite feedback, contributions, and general discussion. 

The initial design and development is lead by [MITâ€™s Media Lab Learning Initiative](http://learn.media.mit.edu/) and [Learning Machine](http://www.learningmachine.com/), but we are actively encouraging other collaborators to get involved.

## How it works

To demonstrate how the project's components can be used, suppose a student is about to graduate from school, and is applying for a job with an employer, who requires proof of graduation:

1. The student requests certificate from the school via the certificate wallet ([cert-wallet](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-wallet))
2. The school issues a certificate to the student ([cert-issuer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-issuer))
3. The student shares their certificate with the employer ([cert-wallet](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-wallet), [cert-viewer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-viewer))
4. The employer may use a 3rd party (verifier) to verify the certificate ([cert-verifier](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-verifier))
