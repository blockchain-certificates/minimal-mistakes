## Blockchain Certificates Project

[MITâ€™s Media Lab Learning Initiative](http://learn.media.mit.edu/) and [Learning Machine](http://www.learningmachine.com/) are building an open-source ecosystem for creating, sharing, and verifying [blockchain-based educational certificates](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/certificates-reputation-and-the-blockchain-aee03622426f). These digital certificates are registered on the Bitcoin blockchain, cryptographically signed, tamper proof, and shareable. Our goal is to enable a wave of innovation that results in learners having the capacity to possess and share official records of achievement. We invite feedback, contributions, and general discussion.

## How it works

To demonstrate how the project's components can be used, suppose a student is about to graduate from school, and is applying for a job with an employer, who requires proof of graduation:

1. The student requests certificate from the school via the certificate wallet ([cert-wallet](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-wallet))
2. The school issues a certificate to the student ([cert-issuer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-issuer))
3. The student shares their certificate with the employer ([cert-wallet](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-wallet), [cert-viewer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-viewer))
4. The employer may use a 3rd party (verifier) to verify the certificate ([cert-verifier](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-verifier))
