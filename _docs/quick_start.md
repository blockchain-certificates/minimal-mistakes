The easiest way for developers to get familiar with Blockchain Certificates is to clone the [cert-viewer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-viewer) repo and 
perform the "quick start" installation steps. We've provided a Docker image to minimize the steps involved. After this, you will be able to view and verify certificates
locally.

Next you might try issuing sample certificates. We've provided a Docker image to allow you to experiment with issuing certificates without the risk of spending money. Clone the [cert-issuer](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-issuer) repo and 
perform the "quick start" installation steps.

Each of our github repositories has detailed information; start with
the README.md for each. Most of our code is in python, and for these
we've provided the following entry points, as appropriate:

- pypi packages for reusable llibraries
- Docker files for quick start
- Flask services or CLI for local runs
