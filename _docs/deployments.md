The following examples illustrate issuer hosted certificates, so the verification button appears beneath the certificate. While Consumers would ideally employ their own verifier, issuers may self-host certificates with a verification button included. Here are four examples below:

* The Media Lab issued digital certificates to Media Lab alumni who attended the Lab's 30th anniversary in October 2015. [See the certificates here](https://coins.media.mit.edu/).
* Learning Machine issued digital certificates to all of its employees. See two example certificates [here](https://hr.learningmachine.com/52d8acfc86584d0c40700631) and [here](https://hr.learningmachine.com/1c56735cd6a4320c61583b9d).
* MIT's Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp issued digital certificates to the students that attended their workshop in Seoul, South Korea in March 2016. [See the certificates here](http://certificates-bootcamp.mit.edu/).
* The Laboratorio para la Ciudad issued digital certificates to participants of a week-long workshop in Mexico City in September 2015. [See the certificates here](http://certs.labcd.mx/).
